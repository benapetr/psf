# psf PHP simple framework - toolkit for html / js / css + many other various
tools I often use on my projects

This simple php framework makes it super easy to create full featured HTML
pages with basically zero knowledge of HTML, CSS or JS. You create web pages
just using the object oriented PHP code and nothing else.

See wiki for a complete documentation.

Please note that PSF is a work in progress and many features are missing now.
